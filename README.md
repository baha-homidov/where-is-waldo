# Barker (Twitter Clone)

A puzzle game based on the Where's Waldo

### Access

- The project is hosted on Github Pages and can be accessed by visiting this link [Where's Waldo (Game Legends Edition)](https://baha-homidov.github.io/where-is-waldo/)
- After winning the game, users can submit their score and have it displayed on the leaderboard if they are in the top 10. Creating an account is not required

### Motivation

This project contains many newly learned technologies and implementations. Some of them are:

- ReactJS
- Firebase Hosting & Firestore Database (NoSQL)
- Have frontend and backend communicate with each other

This project has a good use case of those technologies I've ventured into, and it would be an excellent platform to put them into practice.

### Features

#### Besides the essential technical features such as using ReactJS, Firestore, and others. There are also the following features worth noting:

- Communicating with the backend to verify data
- Sharing users' high scores in a leaderboard
- Tracing clicked area on the photo regardless of the screen size
- Tracking time spend to finish the game
